## Abstract 
An overload of patients has caused an extensive burden on the limited health care staff. To alleviate this issue, the purpose of this study is to aid health care professionals to identify at-risk patients in order to provide prevention methods needed to help patients be proactive with managing their health. The data was initially collected through a health-related telephone survey conducted by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for U.S. residents in conjunction with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In order for this to be carried out, the following six machine learning algorithms were built: Logistic Regression, Neural Network, Random Forest, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, and Decision Tree. These models were evaluated using the following metrics: Precision, Recall, F1, Accuracy, and ROC. It was observed that all six machine learning models provided evidence for the hypothesis that machine learning models can help identify at-risk heart disease patients. Future studies can expand on the current research through the expansion of the research length to include longitudinal data and incorporate further demographic characteristics.

## Business Background
Heart disease claims approximately 17.9 million lives worldwide (World Health Organization: WHO, 2019). On a national level, roughly 2,000 people die in the United States each day from this disease (Heart Disease and Stroke Statistics - 2020 Update, n.d.). Heart disease can be attributed to a variety of factors including smoking, alcoholism, poor dietary choices, and lack of exercise (CDC Heart Disease Facts, 2023). Common biomarkers that indicate the risk of heart disease include cholesterol and blood pressure values. Heart disease encompasses different types of diseases affecting the heart such as heart attacks and coronary artery disease. As one of the leading causes of death in the United States, it is imperative that measures are taken to identify and reduce the prevalence of these deaths among at-risk populations (CDC Heart Disease Facts, 2023). 

## Problem Statement
Prevention of heart disease is much more effective in extending the life of individuals than treating heart disease. Taking steps to identify at-risk patients is imperative to combat this leading cause of death. Overall, it can be noted that heart disease is consuming the lives of many individuals around the world. This fact is a source of motivation for pursuing this topic for our study. Analyzing the statistics in regards to heart disease has shown a need for analysis. Keeping this in mind, we were motivated to explore this topic further by utilizing machine learning algorithms.

## Summary of Findings 
Six machine learning models were built to help doctors identify at-risk patients in order to provide prevention methods needed to help their patients be proactive with managing their health. Based on the six models produced, it can be noted that the model that outperformed all other models was determined to be the Neural Network model. The six models can be ranked as follows from greatest predictability to least predictability: Neural Network, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis, and Decision Tree. It should be noted that all models performed with great proficiency based on their precision, recall, F1, accuracy, and ROC scores, and therefore are sufficient models that can be further expanded on and employed. The results serve as a source of hope that the problem of identifying at-risk heart disease patients in a timely manner can be mitigated through machine learning efforts. Overall, this can lead to the outcome of doctors being able to visit and assist more patients efficiently. Giving patients the opportunity to be diagnosed quickly can lead to them receiving preventative care or treatments which can benefit their overall health. These findings bridge the gap in healthcare settings with patient satisfaction. This is the case in terms of diagnoses considering that the time doctors spend looking through the medical history of a patient to make an accurate diagnosis cuts down on the time a patient has to share their personal concerns with the doctor. The results show potential in reducing this barrier through the automation of the diagnoses process which will lead to better doctor-patient interactions, overall patient satisfaction, and thus this can lead to better health outcomes.

## Business Question
How can we better predict heart disease to reduce the incidence of heart disease, improve doctor-patient interactions, and increase overall profitability of hospitals?

## Limitations 
Some potential limitations of this study that should be considered are as follows: data biases and time constraints. The data obtained for this research project was through a survey-response style, which may indicate that there are some biases that influenced the model estimates as some of the data is subjective. Additionally, since the data was obtained through a volunteer basis, this may have resulted in a limited ability to properly assess the general public. In terms of time as a limitation factor, there was a time constraint on the research project (seven weeks); therefore, a longitudinal approach to this research study was not possible. More time and access to longitudinal data may have better aided with the overall predictability of heart disease.

## Call to Action 
In the future, the study can expand on the current research through a few different methods. First, the Neural Network model can be retested in order to find ways in which it can be improved to better predict heart disease. Also, in the future the impact of each of the attributes could also be further investigated. Subgroup analyses could additionally be conducted on the data to further determine new insights. An example of a subgroup analysis that could further the knowledge gained in this study would be to subset the information by race, sex, or age. These facets of the study may introduce interesting insights. In the future, researchers should also consider including additional demographic attributes such as socioeconomic status, financial burdens, place of residence, occupation, and educational level to expand on knowledge of social factors in relation to heart disease. Another addition to the data that could aid with improving this study would be the inclusion of longitudinal data. Longitudinal data may better help with predicting whether or not individuals are at-risk for heart disease.
